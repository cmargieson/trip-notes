Embarking on an off-road motorbike adventure through Rydal 4WD area in Marrangaroo National Park. Tackled the steep ascent to Mt Walker Trig Station after crossing Cox's River. Unfortunately, a jammed chain cut the trip short.

Entered Lisdale State Forest via Link Road off the Great Western Highway, encountering numerous kangaroos along the initial, easy stretch of the trail.

Crossed Cox's River and reached the summit of Mt Walker Trig Station. Descended Sugarman's Road to Marrangaroo campsite on a bend of the river.

A jammed chain between the sprocket and swing-arm forced a 5-hour off-road recovery back to Lithgow.
