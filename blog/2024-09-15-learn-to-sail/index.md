The Australian sailing pathway starts with "Start Crewing." This stage focuses on developing fundamental skills like tacking and gybing. Next is "Start Helming" which includes an introduction to racing around the cans and man overboard drills. Finally, "Start Skippering" involves taking full responsibility for the boat and crew.
